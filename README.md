#### 5 Branches - 
- Production (master)
- Integration
- HotFix 
- feature1 
- feature2
#### Step : 1
- First, I've set up the Github repository and cloned it locally and next, Main Branch, a branching off of HotFix and Integration Branch, was developed.
#### Step : 2
- Make feature1 and feature2 Branches from the Integration Branch. Add some changes and then adding 2 reviewers who made merging for the pull request to Integration.
#### Step : 3
- Change and commit in feature1 in Local Environment. However, we now seek to act before the merge that occurred in the origin/feature2 Therefore, we run the 'git pull â€”rebase' command to rebase. This implies that when we pull from the remote, our local commit will come first.
#### Step : 4
- Production(main) and HotFix branches now include changes from the Integration branch.
#### Step : 5
- Changes are developed on the HotFix branch and are integrated into the Integration and Production branch.
#### Step : 6
- feature1, feature2, and HotFix branches were ultimately deleted after completing the before mentioned processes.
